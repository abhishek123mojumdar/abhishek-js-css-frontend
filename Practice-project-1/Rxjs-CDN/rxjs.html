<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: ** The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive. -->
<html lang="en">

<!-- The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content.

Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on.  -->

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page. -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <!-- The X-UA-Compatible meta tag allows web authors to choose what version of Internet Explorer the page should be rendered as -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.
            You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:
            The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
            The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. -->
