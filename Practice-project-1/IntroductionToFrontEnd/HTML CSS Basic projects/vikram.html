      On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay
      in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for
      the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a
      substitute fielder.[44] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years
      and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at
      Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the
      youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.[57] He
      was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after
      Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket
      practice nets,[30] where the Indian team had come to play against the
      touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his
      first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic
      tournaments.[58] Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as
      Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77,
      and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[59] In both 1988 and 1999,
      Tendulkar was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the
      Star Cricket Club banner.[60] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which
      Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was key to
      giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only
      70 overs on the final day.[61] At the start of the 1989–90 season, while
      playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten century in an
      Irani Trophy match against Delhi.[62] In the final of 1995 Ranji trophy,
      Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab.[63] In the
      1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India.[63] His
      first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the
      visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[30][64] He is
      the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic
      first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[65]
      Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the
      semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best
      innings of his career.[66][67][68] In total, Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji
      trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4.[63]

        India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is
        a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the
        most populous country as of 1 May 2023, and the most populous democracy
        in the world.[26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the
        Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it
        shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and
        Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
        Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives;
        its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
        Myanmar, and Indonesia.

        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later
        than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, initially in
        varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
        highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31]
        Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the
        Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus
        Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an
        archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into
        India from the northwest.[33][34] Its evidence today is found in the
        hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition,
        the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian
        languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
        regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had
        emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen,
        proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political
        consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires
        based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their collective era was suffused with
        wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of
        women,[41] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised
        system of belief.[k][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
        Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of
        Southeast Asia.[43]
      </p>
      <p >
        In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and
        Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western
        coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran
        India's northern plains,[45] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate,
        and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval
        Islam.[46] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
        long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[47] In the Punjab,
        Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal
        Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[49] leaving
        a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][50] Gradually expanding rule of
        the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial
        economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[51] British Crown rule
        began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
        slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern
        ideas of education and the public life took root.[54] A pioneering and
        influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent
        resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56]
        In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent
        dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
        Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and
        an unprecedented migration.[61]

        India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a
        democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and
        multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951
        to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[62] During the same time, its nominal per
        capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its
        literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute
        country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a
        hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle
        class.[64] It has a space programme which includes several planned or
        completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual
        teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[65] India has
        substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of
        increasing economic inequality.[66] India is a nuclear-weapon state,
        which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir
        with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th
        century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender
        inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air
        pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity
        hotspots.[70] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[71] India's
        wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's
        culture,[72] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in
        protected habitats.
