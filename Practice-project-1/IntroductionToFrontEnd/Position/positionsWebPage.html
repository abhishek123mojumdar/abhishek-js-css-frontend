          On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent
          Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not
          selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was
          often used as a substitute fielder.[44] A year later, on 11 December
          1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay
          against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 not out in that
          match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in
          first-class cricket.[57] He was selected to play for the team by
          Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after Vengsarkar watched him play
          Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets,[30] where the
          Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He
          followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep
          Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[58] Tendulkar
          finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest
          run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the
          eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[59] In both 1988 and 1999,
          Tendulkar was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the
          Star Cricket Club banner.[60] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which
          Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar's 96 from 75 balls was key
          to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from
          only 70 overs on the final day.[61] At the start of the 1989–90
          season, while playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten
          century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi.[62] In the final of
          1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139
          versus Punjab.[63] In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai
          against Rest of India.[63] His first double century (204*) was for
          Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the
          Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[30][64] He is the only player to score a
          century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments
          (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[65] Another double century
          was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the
          2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his
          career.[66][67][68] In total, Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji trophy
          finals, in which Mumbai won 4.[63]

          An article, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is defined as
          “any of a small set of words or affixes (such as a, an, and the) used
          with nouns to limit or give definiteness to the application.”
          According to the Collins Dictionary, “an article is a kind of
          determiner. In English, ‘a’ and ‘an’ are called the indefinite
          article, and ‘the’ is called the definite article.” The Macmillan
          Dictionary defines an article as “a type of determiner (=word used
          before a noun) that shows whether you are referring to a particular
          thing or to a general example of something. The indefinite article is
          ‘a’ or ‘an’ and the definite article is ‘the’.”
