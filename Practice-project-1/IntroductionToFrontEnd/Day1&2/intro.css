/* What is CSS ?
CSS is Cascading style sheet . It is a style language which helps to manipulate the appearance of a markup languages like HTML
Css is the cosmetic of the web

load html --> parse html --> create dom tree -->display webpage
                    |                   |
                load css ------->  parse CSS    

The Ways in which we can apply CSS to an HTML document 
1)  inline
2)  Style block directly inside of a document
3)  Style sheet 

We can use multiple Css file for the the decoration of our HTML
Cascading basically means that style information from multiple sources can be combined together

** Moreover we can have all the above in the same document 
i.e inline , style block  and style sheet in the same document 

in such cases we need to understand the precedence of the styles

Order of precedence

1) Inline styles -->> overrides all styles
2) Style blocks -->> Overrides style sheet
3) Style Sheet -->> last precedence


Default Browser Styles ? 
These are the styles that are pre exisiting  in the browser that give the browser HTML doc a basic structure, by writing css we
override that 

Basic Syntax of a CSS is a selector and properties and values in  a declaration block 

selectors basically denote an element that you want to style 
eg: <p><DIV><span><ul>

inside the declartion block we will have properties and attributes



Basic selectors in CSS

1> Type selectors (element selectors):
These are global in nature which means that it will effect every element with that particular type (Ex)

3> Class Selector
These match the elements based on the contents of their class attribute (Ex)
We can define a certain set of styles for a class and reuse the class where ever we want
.class

3> Id Selector

effects the element with a corresponding ID. This is used if we specifically want to target a particular element (Ex)
#id

4> Descendant Selector

Matches all elements that are the descendant of a particular element

div span {
    color : blue 
}

Remeber the syntax ... separate the selectors by space

Combinators

Descendant Seletors (space)
Child selectore (>)
Matches the direct child of the DIV

div > span {
    color : blue 
}

div > span {
    color : blue ;
    font-weight: 300;
    transform: scaleY(1);
    transition: all 0.4s ease;
}

div > span:hover {
    font-weight: 900;
    transform: scaleY(2);
    cursor: pointer;
}

Adjacent sibling selector (+)

This gets applied when an element is a sibling / adjancent to another element

p + span {
    color : red 
}

General sibling selector (~)

All the elements that are on the same level

p ~ span {
    color : red 
}


How does CSS loads on to your HTML


#id .class span {
    color : yellow 
}

css is read form right to left

Last mentioned style of an element is picked up

/* p {
    background-color: red; text-align: center; color: aliceblue;
} */


div span {
    color : red;
    background-color: black;
}

div p {
    color : white;
    background-color: red;
}
